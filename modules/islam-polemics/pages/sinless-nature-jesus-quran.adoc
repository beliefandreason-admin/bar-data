= The Sinless Nature of Jesus in the Quran

In the quran, Jesus is portrayed as a sinless prophet who was born of the virgin Mary and performed miracles by the will of Allah. The Quranic account of Jesus' life emphasizes his purity and righteousness, highlighting his role as a messenger of God

What is interesting is that Jesus is greater than Muhammed in his sinless nature. According to Islamic tradition, all human beings are born with the touch of Satan except for Jesus, who was protected from sin by Allah. This unique status of Jesus as a sinless prophet is a testament to his special role in the eyes of God.

[quote, Sahih al-Bukhari 3286]
The Prophet (ï·º) said, "When any human being is born. Satan touches him at both sides of the body with his two fingers, except Jesus, the son of Mary, whom Satan tried to touch but failed, for he touched the placenta-cover instead."

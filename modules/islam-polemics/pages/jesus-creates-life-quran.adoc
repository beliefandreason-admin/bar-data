= Jesus Creates Life in the Quran
Again greater than Muhammed, Jesus creates life in the Quran.

Ali Imran 3:49
[quote, Ali Imran 3:49]
"and [make him] a messenger to the Children (and when he has become) I have come to you with a sign from your Lord in that I design for you from clay [that which is] like the form of a bird, then I breathe into it and it becomes a bird by permission of Allah. And I cure the blind and the leper, and I give life to the dead - by permission of Allah. And I inform you of what you eat and what you store in your houses. Indeed in that is a sign for you, if you are believers."

= Kissing the Pagan Black Stone

The Black Stone is a sacred stone in Islam that is located in the Kaaba in Mecca. It is believed to have been sent down from heaven by Allah. The kaaba is Allah's house. The black stone is kissed by pilgrims during the Hajj and Umrah as a sign of respect and devotion and worship. The black stone is a pagan practice that has been incorporated into Islam.

According to tradition, this stone was given to Adam on his expulsion from paradise (In space) in order to obtain forgiveness of his sins.

[quote, Sunan an-Nasa'i 2935]
"O Abu abdur-Rahman, why do I only see you touching these two corners?" He said: "I heard the Messenger of Allah say: **'Touching them erases sins.'** And I head him say: 'whoever circumambulates seven times, **it is like freeing a slave.**'"

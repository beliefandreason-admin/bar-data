= Introduction to the Book of Daniel

The Book of Daniel is a significant text in both the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Old Testament. 
It is attributed to Daniel, a Jewish nobleman who was taken into Babylonian captivity. 
The book is divided into two main sections: a series of court history (chapters 1-6) and a series of apocalyptic visions (chapters 7-12).

== Themes

The Book of Daniel explores themes such as:

- **Faithfulness**: The unwavering commitment of Daniel and his friends to their faith.
- **Divine Sovereignty**: The belief that God is in control of history and the fate of nations.
- **Hope and Deliverance**: The promise of God's deliverance for those who remain faithful.



== Qumran Discovery and Canonical Status

The discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls at Qumran in the mid-20th century **included fragments of the Book of Daniel**. 
These scrolls date back to the **late 2nd century BC**, providing evidence that the Book of Daniel was considered canonical and authoritative by the Jewish community at that time. 

**This obliterates the former criticisms that the Book of Daniel was written after the events it prophesied**.

From noted scholar Dr. Marius Nel, __"The Qumran discovery of the Book of Daniel is a significant find that confirms the antiquity and canonical status of the book in Jewish tradition."__

.Daniel was Scripture at Qumran
[quote, On Qumran Discover, Dr. Marius Nel]
"The way in which Daniel was used at Qumran shows its authoritative
status. For instance, the Florilegium (4Q174) quotes Daniel 12:10 with the accompanying words,
**“as written in the book of Daniel, the prophet”**. This shows that Daniel was regarded as Scripture,
and may even have belonged to the Nebi’im in the Qumran community."

== Historical Context

The historical narrative begins **during the Babylonian exile**, a period when the Jewish people were deported from the Kingdom of Judah to Babylon. 
This historical backdrop **is crucial for understanding** the themes of faith, perseverance, and divine intervention that permeate the book.



== Structure and Content

The **first half of the book** contains the histories of Daniel and his friends, who remain faithful to their God despite facing various trials and challenges in a foreign land.
 These histories include the famous accounts of the **fiery furnace, the writing on the wall, and Daniel in the lion's den**.

The **second half of the book** shifts to apocalyptic literature, featuring visions and prophecies **about the future**. These visions provide insight into the rise and fall of empires, the coming of the Messiah, and the ultimate triumph of God's kingdom.



== Prophecies

The Book of Daniel contains several notable prophecies, including:

- **The Four Beasts (Daniel 7)**: A vision of four great beasts representing successive empires, culminating in the establishment of God's everlasting kingdom.
 The empires identified in Daniel 7 are the **Babylonian Empire**, the **Medo-Persian Empire**, the **Greek Empire**, and the **Roman Empire**.

- **The Ram and the Goat (Daniel 8)**: A vision depicting the conflict between the Medo-Persian Empire (the ram) and the Greek Empire (the goat). 
This conflict is interpreted as a prophecy of the rise of Alexander the Great (Prominent horn) and his conquest of the Medio-Persian Empire. 
The vision also foretells the division of Alexander's empire among his generals after his death.

- **The Seventy Weeks (Daniel 9)**: A prophecy outlining a period of seventy 'weeks' (interpreted as seventy sets of seven years) leading to the coming of an anointed one and the ultimate redemption.

- **The Kings of the North and South (Daniel 11)**: A detailed prophecy describing the conflicts between the Ptolemaic and Seleucid empires, leading up to the time of the end.

- **The Time of the End (Daniel 12)**: A vision of the end times, including the resurrection of the dead and the final judgment.



== Conclusion

Daniel has inspired countless readers with its history of courage,visions of hope and the fortelling of God. In Daniel 9:24 we are provided with an expectation of the coming messiah the one who will be cut off whose purpose is:
 
- **to finish transgression,**
- **to put an end to sin,**
- **to atone for wickedness,**
- **to bring in everlasting righteousness,**
- **to seal up vision and prophecy,**
- **to anoint the most holy.**

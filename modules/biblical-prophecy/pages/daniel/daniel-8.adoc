== Daniel Chapter 8

Daniel Chapter 8 contains a vision given to the prophet Daniel during the third year of King Belshazzar's reign. The vision is of a ram and a goat, which are interpreted by the angel Gabriel.

=== The Vision

- **The Ram**: The ram has two horns, **one longer than the other**, representing the kings of Media and Persia. **Media was the first kingdom to rise to power, followed by Persia, which became the dominant kingdom.**

[quote, daniel 8:3-4]
The ram had two horns, both long, but one was longer than the other, and the longer one came up last. I saw the ram charging westward and northward and southward. No beast could stand before him, and there was no one who could rescue from his power; he did as he pleased and became great. 

- **The Goat**: The goat has a single prominent horn between its eyes, symbolizing the first king of Greece (Alexander the Great). The goat (Alexander the Great) defeats the ram (Media and Persia), and the goat's prominent horn is broken (Alexander the Great dies) who is then replaced by four notable horns, representing the division of Alexander's empire among his four generals.

[quote,daniel 8:5-8]
As I was considering this, behold, a goat came from the west across the face of the whole earth, without touching the ground. And the goat had a conspicuous horn between his eyes. He came to the ram with the two horns, which I had seen standing on the bank of the canal, and he ran at him in his powerful wrath. I saw him come close to the ram, and he was enraged against him and struck the ram and broke his two horns. And the ram had no power to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground and trampled on him. And there was no one who could rescue the ram from his power. Then the goat became exceedingly great, **but when he was strong, the great horn was broken**, and instead of it there came up **four conspicuous horns toward the four winds of heaven**.

- **The Goat**: The goat has a single prominent horn between its eyes, symbolizing the first king of Greece (Alexander the Great). The goat (Alexander the Great) defeats the ram (Media and Persia), and the goats prominent horn is broken (Alexander the Great dies) who is then replaced by four notable horns, representing the division of Alexander's empire among his four generals.

- **Cassander**: Took control of Macedonia and Greece.
- **Lysimachus**: Governed Thrace and parts of Asia Minor.
- **Ptolemy**: Ruled over Egypt and neighboring regions.
- **Seleucus**: Controlled the bulk of Alexander's Asian territories, including Syria and Persia.


=== Interpretation

Gabriel explains that the vision pertains to the "time of the end" and the "appointed time of wrath." The ram represents the Medo-Persian Empire, and the goat represents the Greek Empire. The large horn is Alexander the Great, and the four horns are the four kingdoms that arose after his death which preceeded from his four generals.

== Historical Fulfillment
These prophecies were fulfilled in history as follows:

- **Medo-Persian Empire**: The ram with two horns symbolizes the Medo-Persian Empire, which was a significant power in the ancient Near East.

- **Greek Empire**: The goat represents the Greek Empire under Alexander the Great, who swiftly conquered the Medo-Persian Empire.

- **Division of Alexander's Empire**: After Alexander's death, his empire was divided among his four generals: Cassander, Lysimachus, Ptolemy, and Seleucus.

== Qumran Discovery

The discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls at Qumran in the mid-20th century **included fragments of the Book of Daniel**. These scrolls date back to the **late 2nd century BC**, providing evidence that the Book of Daniel was considered canonical and authoritative by the Jewish community at that time. **This obliterates the former criticisms that the Book of Daniel was written after the events it prophesied**.

From noted scholar Dr. Marius Nel, "The Qumran discovery of the Book of Daniel is a significant find that confirms the antiquity and canonical status of the book in Jewish tradition."

"The way in which Daniel was used at Qumran shows its authoritative
status. For instance, the Florilegium (4Q174) quotes Daniel 12:10 with the accompanying words,
**“as written in the book of Daniel, the prophet”**. This shows that Daniel was regarded as Scripture,
and may even have belonged to the Nebi’im in the Qumran community."

== Conclusion

Daniel Chapter 8 provides a prophetic vision that aligns with historical events involving the Medo-Persian and Greek empires. The Qumran discovery further supports the canonical status of the Book of Daniel in ancient Jewish tradition.

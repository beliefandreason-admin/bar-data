:toc:


== Introduction
The concept of the Messiah in Jewish and Christian traditions encompasses various roles, including that of a **prophet, priest, and king**. These three functions are central to the Messianic expectations found in the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament. The fulfillment of these roles by the Messiah is seen as essential for **the restoration and redemption** of God's people. This article explores the prophetic, priestly, and kingly aspects of the Messiah **as foretold** in the scriptures and **fulfilled in the person of Jesus Christ**.



== The Messiah as Prophet
One of the **key roles attributed to the Messiah** in biblical prophecy is that of a **prophet**. The Messiah is seen as a spokesperson for God who communicates divine messages to the people. This prophetic function is highlighted in various Old Testament passages that describe **the Messiah as a teacher**, **a revealer** of God's will, and a guide for the people. The fulfillment of these prophecies in the person of Jesus Christ underscores his role as **a prophet like Moses**, who speaks on behalf of God and reveals and physically embodies **the truth** to humanity.

Prophecy: Deuteronomy 18:15

== The Messiah as Priest
In addition to being a prophet, the Messiah is **also depicted as a priest** in the order of Melchizedek. This priestly role emphasizes the Messiah's function **as a mediator between God and humanity**, offering sacrifices for the forgiveness of sins and interceding on behalf of the people. **The fulfillment of this priestly prophecy in Jesus Christ is seen in his sacrificial death on the cross**, where he atoned for the sins of the world and reconciled humanity to God through his blood.

The Messiah's kingship is associated **with the line of David**, fulfilling the promise of a descendant **who will rule forever**. Jesus Christ's fulfillment of this kingly prophecy is evident in his triumphal entry into Jerusalem, where he was hailed
as the King. His crucifixion and resurrection also underscore his **victory over sin and death** and his establishment of an eternal kingdom that will never end.

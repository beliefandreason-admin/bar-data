[quote, text with strikeouts are missing from fragments]
____
3 But you are the [.line-through]#holy one#, who inhabits the praises of Israel. 
4 Our ancestors put their trust in you; they trusted; you delivered them. 
5 They cried to you, and were saved; they trusted in you, and were not put to shame. 
6 But [.line-through]#as for me#, I am a worm, and not human, scorned by others and despised by the people. 
7 All who see me [.line-through]#ridicule me; they make faces at me# and shake their heads: 
8 “Commit yourself to the LORD! Let him deliver—let him rescue him, since he delights in him!”▲
14 [.line-through]#I have# been poured out  [.line-through]#like water, and all# my bon [.line-through]#es are out of joint. My heart has turned to wax; it has mel# ted away in my breast. 
15 [.line-through]#My strength is dried up like a potsherd#, and my tongue melts in [.line-through]#my mouth. They# have placed [.line-through]#me# as the dust of death.

16 [.line-through]#For# dogs are [.line-through]#all around me#; a gang of evil [.line-through]#doers# encircles me. #They have pierced my hands and my feet#. <<c>>

17 [.line-through]#I can count all of my bones; people stare and gloat over me. 
18 They divide my garments among themselves, and they cast lots for my# clothes.
19 But as for you, [.line-through]#O LORD, do not be far away! O you my strength, come quickly to my aid. 
20 Deliver my soul from the sword, my precious life from the power of the dogs!#

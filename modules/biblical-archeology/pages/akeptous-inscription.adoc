The inscription, written in Greek, reads:

"Η Ακεπτους θεοφιλ(ε)ς την τραπεζαν εθετο τῷ [Θεῷ] Ἰησοῦ Χριστῷ εἰς μνείαν."

Translation:
"Akeptous, lover of God, offered this table for (the) **god Jesus Christ**, as **a remembrance**."

Key points about the Akeptous Inscription:

Location and Archaeology:: It was found during excavations at an ancient Roman military camp near Megiddo, specifically in what appears to be the remains of an early Christian house church.

Historical Significance:: The inscription is important because it references Jesus Christ directly, suggesting that by the 3rd century, Christians were openly using this name in religious dedications. The term “**god Jesus Christ**” indicates the divinity of Jesus, which was an established belief by this time.

The Church and Christianity:: The house church where the inscription was found is one of the oldest known Christian worship sites, giving scholars a glimpse into how early Christian communities might have worshipped in small, private spaces before Christianity became widely recognized in the Roman Empire.

Akeptous:: The name "Akeptous" likely refers to a woman (possibly a benefactor) who donated the table used in Christian gatherings, which could have been an altar or a communal table used for the Eucharist.
